                <p>Most data in the Datatsets Discovery Index can be accessed programmatically using a <a
                        href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ddi/ws/">RESTful API</a>
                    allowing for integration with other resources. The API implementation is based on the

                <h2 id="web-browsable-api">Web browsable API</h2>

                <p>The OmicsDI API is <strong>web browsable</strong>, which means that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>The query results returned by the API are available in <a href="http://json.org/"

                        This ensures that they can be viewed by human and accessed programmatically by computer.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>The main <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ddi/ws/" target="_blank">RESTful API</a> page
                            provides a simple web-based user interface, which allows developers to familiarise
                            themselves with the API and get a better sense of the OmicsDI data before writing a single line of
                            code. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>many resources are <strong>hyperlinked</strong> so that it's possible to navigate the API in
                        the browser.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>As a result, developers can familiarise themselves with the API and get a better sense of the OmicsDI

                <p>
                    To ensure that changes in the OmicsDI API don't break the applications relying on it, the API is
                    versioned, and the version is included in the API's URL.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, the current API is at Version 1 and is available at
                    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ddi/ws/v1, and
                    the next version will be available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ddi/ws/v2.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The latest version of the API can be accessed at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ddi/ws/current, but it's
                    not
                    recommended to use this endpoint for long-term development as the underlying data model may change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    No backward-incompatible changes are made to a version after it has been made public. More
                    specifically, it's guaranteed that within one version there will be no:

                </ul>
                <p>
                    The following non-disruptive changes may be implemented to a public API:

    "description": "Protein biomarkers can be used to characterize and diagnose disease states such as cancer. They can also serve as therapeutic targets. Current methods for protein biomarker discovery, which generally rely on the large-scale analysis of gene and/or protein expression levels, fail to detect protein biomarkers with disease-related functions and unaltered expression levels. Here we describe the large-scale use of thermodynamic measurements of protein folding and stability for disease state characterization and the discovery of protein biomarkers. Using the Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture and Stability of Proteins from Rates of Oxidation (SILAC-SPROX) technique, we assayed ~800 proteins for protein folding and stability changes in three different cell culture models of breast cancer including the MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. The thermodynamic stability profiles generated here created distinct molecular markers for the three cell lines, and a significant fraction (~45%) of the differentially stabilized proteins did not have altered expression levels. Thus, the protein biomarkers reported here created novel molecular signatures of breast cancer and provided additional insight into the molecular basis of the disease. Our results establish the utility of protein folding and stabilitymeasurements for the study of disease processes.",

The enzyme was set as Trypsin, and up to 2 missed cleavages were permitted. The false discovery rate for peptide and protein identifications was set to1%, and rest of the parameters were set at the default settings. As part of the default settings the mass tolerancefor precursor ions was set to 20 ppm for the first search where initial mass recalibration was completed and a 6 ppmprecursor mass tolerance was used for the main search. The mass tolerance for fragment ions was 0.5 Da. We alsoincluded match between runs and re-quantification of the searched peptides. The search results were exported toExcel for further data analysis as described below. Only the protein and peptide identifications with non-zeropositive ratios (H/L >0) were used in subsequent data analysis steps. The methionine-containing peptides wereselected, and those methionine-containing peptides consistently identified in the protein samples derived from sixor more denaturant-containing buffers were assayed. For the methionine-containing peptides, a single averaged H/Lratio was calculated for each peptide sequence and each charge state at each denaturant concentration. Similarly,for each analysis a median H/L ratio was determined for each protein using the H/L ratios measured for all thenon-methionine-containing peptides identified in all the denaturant concentrations for a given protein. These medianH/L ratios were used to select hits with H/L>2 fold in the protein expression level analyses. For hit peptide andprotein selection in the thermodynamic analyses, all the H/L ratios generated for the non-methionine containingpeptides from a given protein were divided by the median H/L ratio for that protein in order to generate normalizedH/L ratios for each non-methionine containing peptide. These normalized H/L ratios were log2 transformed. Thenormalized and log2 transformed H/L ratios generated for the non-methionine-containing peptides in a given analysiswere used to determine the 5th and 95th percentiles values used in subsequent analysis of methionine-containingpeptides. The averaged H/L ratios calculated for each methionine-containing peptides were also normalized and log2transformed. The methionine-containing peptides and proteins with log2 transformed H/L ratios less than the 5thpercentile or greater than the 95th percentile values determined above were selected and then visually inspected todetermine which peptides had altered H/L ratios at 2 or more consecutive denaturant concentrations to generate aninitial list of protein hits.",
    "sample_protocol": "SILAC labeled MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lysates were prepared according to established SILAC protocols. Aliquots of each lysate were distributed into a series of denaturant-containing buffers, reacted with hydrogen peroxide under conditions that selectively oxidize exposed methionine residues, and quenched with the addition of excess methionine. The light and heavy samples generated at matching denaturant concentration were combined. Each combined protein sample was submitted to a bottom-up, solution-phase, shotgun proteomics analysis using LC-MS/MS. Ultimately, L/H ratios were obtained for the peptides detected at each denaturant concentration, and the denaturant dependence of the L/H ratio’s was examined."
